# Contributing to the casc wiki

## How does it work?

The casc wiki is hosted on a website called github for hosting code and stuff. If you'd like to edit and create posts, you'll need to create a github account.

## How to create and edit pages

### Creating pages

To create a page in on the casc wiki, you can hit the button that says **add new** next to "Prose.io". Prose.io is a visual editor that you can use to create the files that the wiki uses to create pages. If you'd like to see the source of the file you click on the buttons that don't say "Prose.io" next to them. 

#### Using Prose.io

When you first open prose.io to create a new file, you will need to login with github by hitting the button in the bottom right of the page, linking your github account to the website. You can then change the name of the file that you are creating to what you'd like the page to be called in the url. For example it could look like **"wiki/geb.md"** to create a page about geb üòÅ. You can then add all the data you'd like for the geb using the **markdown** format. If you'd like to know everything you can do with markdown, such as links, images, headers, and text formating, github has a [nice guide.](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Once you have edited the page to your liking, you can hit the save changes button the side of the page. If you're creating the page you can hit the **commit** button to submit your changes. This change will create a **pull request**. A pull request is just a request to change the wiki's github repository. This request can then be reviewed by me or any other mods that I might permit to accept or deny them in the future.
